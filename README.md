# adhdcli
This is a cli tool to track tasks for people with adhd


# Why CLI

If you are working in software or product management it is likely that you have access to a cli or use one on a daily basis. This means it will not be a difficult tool to include in your every day routine

It doesn't require you to go to a website after install to manage your tasks. Navigating to a website as a person with adhd is a trap - you never know what thing is going to distract you on the way. Also a lot of web based tools do have fancy interfaces and those with adhd will spend a lot of time making things look nice instead of using the tool to track things

It doesn't required your phone which has similar distraction issues as a website.
